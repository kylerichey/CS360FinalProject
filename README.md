# CS360FinalProject

##Executive Summary
The goal of this project was to create an incremental game about the life of a college student
using the MEAN stack. Although other games of this type exist, this project is unique because it
uses user authentication to store and save the game state. This allows players to save the
game at any point and return to it on any computer. This goal resulted in a complete and
enjoyable game with potential for additional content.

##Functional Description
The goal this application is to be a fun and addicting game. Games of this type are not meant to
always be actively played. Instead it is intended that it runs in the background for some interval
of time. When the player returns to the game, he can quickly spend the accumulated resources
and queue up new activities for the next time. It is intended that the player is able to spend as
much time as he wants in the game during any given session, while still enjoying an engaging
experience. This is accomplished by creating short and long term activities within the game.
Some resources accumulate quickly and cap out, while others generate slowly without any limit.

hour.
